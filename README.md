Hey my dudes,

I thought a bit on the "how to organise the repo" and I will just impose myself. You may buy a guillotine on etsy ([click here](https://www.etsy.com/de/listing/1753736480/arbeitsmodell-der-franzosischen?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_de_de_de_-home_and_living&utm_custom1=_k_Cj0KCQjwlMfABhCWARIsADGXdy_EicDvn0yMF42J9jhcIl0nmYTVmjNSCgTwIJz9vNJBHnR8uPJVB2IaAsN6EALw_wcB_k_&utm_content=go_11031605255_113518211252_461583033520_pla-303628061699_c__1753736480dede_5569193248&utm_custom2=11031605255&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADutTMfrofvBOzhO90ZZiq7AVUhbS&gclid=Cj0KCQjwlMfABhCWARIsADGXdy_EicDvn0yMF42J9jhcIl0nmYTVmjNSCgTwIJz9vNJBHnR8uPJVB2IaAsN6EALw_wcB) if you don't like it, or just tell me - depending on what you prefer...

Smallish guideline:
- [ ] You are the first uploading for this weeks' homework? you might have to create a directory "HW_xy"
- [ ] You are uploading? Make sure you have added your Task_xy.pynb and your Task_xy.pdf version 
- [ ] You are the last uploading for this weeks' homework? Please unify the pdfs+remove the old ones
- [ ] You think this organisation thingy is beneath you? Let me procrastinate.

I believe this guideline will probably change once we start working, but..."insert reason here"
